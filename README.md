This was born out of an insane attempt to copy something faster than 'cp'. You should very likely ignore this.

# Installing moonshine-copy
```
git clone https://github.com/mglantz/moonshine-copy
cd moonshine-copy
gcc -O3 moonshine-copy.c -o moonshine-copy
chmod a+rx moonshine-copy
cp moonshine-copy /bin
```
